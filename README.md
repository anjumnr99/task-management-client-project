## Everything I have done on this website :

- This is a task management website. In this website user can a task add, remove and edit. User can also  mark a task as a complete task. 
- After clicking the Explore button of landing page user will redirect to the dashboard. If user is not login then he/she will redirect to login page and after login user can see a dashboard.
- On the dashboard user will see the default To-Do list. If user added any task he/she will see here otherwise will not show anything.
- Clicking on Create a new task user will redirect to task adding page, here user can add a task and for adding a task user have to give a title , date and a description.
- I have used firebase authentication and using this I stored the user name and email in the database with users all task information. So everytime after login user will see his/her tasks.
